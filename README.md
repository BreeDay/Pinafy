Pinafy is a FinTech application leveraging Rapyd payment system to decrease the amount of abandoned shopping carts by giving users the option to make money on purcheses by investing in the company. 

You can checkout Pinafy at: https://www.pinafy.com

To test Pinafy:

-Download the application
-Provide API Keys and checkout ID
-Install Dependencies (npm install inside assets directory)

These steps worked for me while initially developing Pinafy, but I did run into some issues with the API calls later into testing.
